# How to play
* There are four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or clicked.
* A round in the game consists of one button being pressed in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons.
* As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases and the player must be sure to remember the **particular sequence** in which the buttons are pressed.
* Once the game is over press any key on the keyboard to start again.
